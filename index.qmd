The Web Archive Manager is part of the toolkit developed by the [Digital Observatory](https://www.digitalobservatory.net.au/) to aid researchers in working
with web archives.

WAM allows you to organise, replay, and annotate your archive files (.wacz or .warc). You can also use WAM to scrape data into structured formats.
