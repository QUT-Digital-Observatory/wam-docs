title: "Web Archive Manager (WAM)"
---

The Web Archive Manager (WAM) is part of the toolkit to aid researchers in working
with web archives. Our aim is to enable usage of archives as a research data source.

WAM allows you to organise, replay, and annotate your archive files (.wacz or .warc). You can also use WAM to scrape data into structured formats.

WAM is developed by [QUT Digital Observatory](https://www.digitalobservatory.net.au/), as part of the [Australian Internet Observatory (AIO)](https://internetobservatory.org.au/). AIO received co-investment ([doi.org/10.3565/hjrp-b141](https://doi.org/10.3565/hjrp-b141)) from the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC) through the [HASS and Indigenous Research Data Commons](https://ardc.edu.au/hass-and-indigenous-research-data-commons/). The ARDC is enabled by the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS).

##### Naming conventions for metadata titles

Metadata titles are case sensitive, meaning `metadataTitle` and `metadatatitle` will be taken as two different words.

No spaces or special characters are allowed. The only special character you can use is @.

Standard metadata such as file, timestamp, size, and tags are reserved, so if you try to add a metadata title using these words, they will be ignored.

**Examples of acceptable metadata titles**: authorName, authorname, @authorName.
